job test game 


Controls: Left ot Right arrow keys, or traditional A and D. Spacebar is for jump.

Game is permanently making itself faster, velocity value is determined in "Player script" block of the Unity editor.

Has a very small bug: after you changed speed of player with the slider, click on game itself, to uncheck the slider, or you will be moving slider up and down, instead of moving the player
