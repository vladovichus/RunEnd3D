# RunEnd3D
Job test game 

To start the game, download this repo, unpack it and add to the Unity editor.
Then start "EndlessRunnerTest" scene file in Assets folder, and then press "Play" button :)

Controls: Left ot Right arrow keys, or traditional A and D. Spacebar is for jump.

Game is permanently making itself faster, velocity value is determined in "Player script" block of the Unity editor.


P.S
Has a very small bug/glitch: after you changed speed of player with the slider, click on game itself, to uncheck the slider, or you will be moving slider up and down, instead of moving the player
